At first I want to define the project for you.
Assume that we have a bag which has a limited volume and we have a list of goods which have 2 parameters 1- available amount 2- value.
We have to pack our bag with the highest value. In this project I've used mutation and crossover algorithm.
Method of defining the gens and values are available in my jupyter note book and csv file.
Good luck.
