    "1- If the population become small we lost the variety and there is a big chance that our crossover function and our algorithm doesn't work properly and in this situation the mutation algorithm work better,Despite the fact that is lead us in to the faster iterations it leads us in to the worse answer, and if our population become too big is is true that we have a wide variety and it leads us into the better solution but it leads us to a slower iterations. \n",
    "\n",
    "2-Due to the fact that our Gens become better after increasing our population, the number of the better gen increases and it makes our chance for finding the more better gens more(increasing our precise), but it leads us into the slower iteration as result of the overpopulation.(become slower)\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Crossover as result of having wide variety works well for the big population, and mutation algorithm as a result of not effecting by the population significantly it works properly for wide range of population.To answer this question I have to say that because we don't have any data about the number of our population it is better to use both algorithm and controll our solution with hyper parameter.(It is better not to choose only one.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4- I think preprocessing and defining the gens properly. For example by deleteing the gens that has a significant different from the settled parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5- I think it is true (As result of my report part), for overcoming this problem we should make a new generation with the better generation that are chosen by the fitness function. Another thing that we can do is to use more efficient algorithm which depends on our problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "6- We can stop the algorithm after specific number of running and checke them with the fitness function, if not any sensible change happened we can stop and think for the better algorithms and defenitions for getting better result. "
